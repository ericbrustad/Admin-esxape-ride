## Update Log

  - Direct links: `.vercelignore`, `.env`, `public/games/*`, `game/public/games/*`, `public/media/`, `game/public/media/`
  - Notes: Removed committed binaries, replaced media references with hosted placeholders, and disabled the /game deploy path by default.
- 2025-10-13 — Restored admin dashboard stack and added Mission 004 sample scenario. Commit: 0254e68
  - Direct links: `pages/index.jsx`, `pages/api/*`, `public/games/004`, `game/public/games/004`
  - Notes: Rehydrated full admin UI (components, lib, API routes) and seeded a new scavenger-hunt flow for teams.
- 2025-10-13 — Admin password protection API fix. Commit: 6ff58c6ee5795a7ee78809f83e5d6b0ffa597ead.
  - Direct link: `pages/api/admin-protection.js`
  - Notes: Restores the admin password toggle endpoint and always keeps the game password state off.

Files included (drop into your Next.js project or use as reference):

/components
  - DevicesList.jsx            // Updated device list with up/down, full-row select, thumbnail, inline editor with Trigger ticker & target dropdown
  - InlineMissionResponses.jsx // Updated mission response editor with "Mark as Trigger" switch and preview badge
  - MissionListItem.jsx        // Small mission list item that displays response marker and thumbnail

components/AppDemo.jsx         // Simple demo usage of components (not part of your app; for reference)

How to use:
- Copy files into your project's components/ folder.
- Import DevicesList where you render the Device sidebar.
  Example: import DevicesList from '../components/DevicesList'
- Import InlineMissionResponses where you manage mission editor responses.
  Example: import InlineMissionResponses from '../components/InlineMissionResponses'

Notes:
- The components are intentionally self-contained and use inline styles for easy drop-in.
- They expect the parent to handle persistence (saving to missions.json/config).
- The 'Trigger Target' dropdown uses a `triggerDevices` prop; if empty it shows 'None available'.
- The DevicesList inline editor provides a 'Triggered Device (ticker)' input per your request.

If you want, I can:
- Integrate these components into your actual pages/index.jsx and wire up your existing state/handlers.
- Convert styles to your project's theme or CSS modules.
- Add accessible keyboard support for reordering and selection.
