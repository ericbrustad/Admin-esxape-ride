## Update Log
- 2025-10-16 ‚Äî Meta banner headline & deployment timestamp refresh. Commit: (pending HEAD)
  - Direct links: `pages/index.jsx`, `README.txt`
  - Notes: Elevated the branch/deployment headline so the admin banner always shows the current branch, deployment target, and a timestamp at the very top, keeping the preview nonce hooks retired to prevent undefined setter calls. Note to review @ 2025-10-16 04:05:00Z.
- 2025-10-16 ‚Äî Meta banner git fallback & removed unused test preview. Commit: (pending HEAD)
  - Direct links: `pages/api/admin-meta.js`, `pages/index.jsx`
  - Notes: The deployment banner now pulls the active git branch/commit even when environment vars are missing, shows timezone-aware timestamps, treats missing Vercel credentials as a disabled state instead of an error, and removes the unused Test preview panel to cut extra DOM nodes while keeping the Game folder and password toggles off by default. Note to review @ 2025-10-16 02:08:36Z.
- 2025-10-16 ‚Äî Admin protection toggle parsing & Next build verification. Commit: (pending HEAD)
  - Direct links: `pages/api/admin-protection.js`
  - Notes: Accepts "false"/"true" strings from the dashboard toggle so the password stays off by default, keeps the admin and game JSON copies synchronized, and reran `npm run build` to confirm the Next.js admin bundle succeeds after restoring the game stylesheet. Note to review @ 2025-10-16 00:46:47Z.
- 2025-10-16 ‚Äî Admin protection sync & game CSS guard. Commit: 49eafe7cd5384c38bebca33b1fc201b6f7c66079
  - Direct links: `pages/api/admin-protection.js`, `game/styles/globals.css`
  - Notes: Keeps the admin password toggle defaulted off while syncing the game JSON copies without forcing them back to false, and restores the game Next build by shipping the missing `styles/globals.css` so Vercel no longer fails on the module lookup. Note to review @ 2025-10-16 00:41:00Z.
- 2025-10-15 ‚Äî Mission response normalization and legacy page archive. Commit: 0b52af3a53ef71c50f26765bdb681ffa9d197c21
  - Direct links: `components/InlineMissionResponses.jsx`, `docs/legacy-pages/`
  - Notes: Normalizes the mission response editor state before rendering so missing response blocks can no longer trigger the New Mission application error, and relocates historical admin page backups into `docs/legacy-pages` to prevent duplicate page routes from crashing the dashboard. Note to review @ 2025-10-15 15:32:10Z.
- 2025-10-15 ‚Äî Header blur, cover save workflow, and media deletion fix. Commit: 97242a44ebaa6cbc54e9227762a211b57cb39e90
  - Direct links: `pages/index.jsx`, `components/AssignedMediaTab.jsx`, `components/InlineMissionResponses.jsx`, `pages/api/list-media.js`
  - Notes: Centered the Admin Control Deck title on a blurred header band with a brighter Save & Publish button, expanded the cover workspace with a dedicated Save Cover Image action, removed thumbnail clutter, hardened mission response rendering, and made Media Pool deletions respect repository paths. Note to review @ 2025-10-15 15:13:39Z.
- 2025-10-15 ‚Äî Mission response inventory guards. Commit: 6eefb17e218f1a40bdcfa303fafbe8ccb56d6743
  - Direct links: `components/InlineMissionResponses.jsx`
  - Notes: Sanitizes the mission response media grid so null or string-only inventory items can't crash new mission drafts and keeps the drag-and-drop selector stable for PNG/JPG uploads under 1 MB.
  - Note to review @ 2025-10-15 14:49:27Z.
- 2025-10-15 ‚Äî Assigned Media & mission error guards plus inline upload base64 fix. Commit: c02c87eaa1d6cf520eb96746d4c3807e8784423f
  - Direct links: `pages/index.jsx`, `components/InlineMissionResponses.jsx`, `components/SafeBoundary.jsx`, `.npmrc`
  - Notes: Wraps the mission response editor and Assigned Media tab in a reusable safe boundary so runtime issues render inline with a retry button instead of crashing the page, switches mission drag-and-drop uploads to a chunked base64 reader to keep PNG/JPG assets under 1‚ÄØMB from breaking, and resets npm to the public registry for connectivity checks. Note to review @ 2025-10-15 14:32:40Z.
- 2025-10-15 ‚Äî Admin protection state guard & npm proxy note. Commit: fc04b5884f75dee9b4ed0cf773549de2669533b9
  - Direct links: `pages/index.jsx`, `.npmrc`
  - Notes: Moves the password protection hooks ahead of the loader effect to stop the Admin dashboard from throwing a ReferenceError on load and drops a local npm registry override so installs can be pointed at an allowed mirror when access is restored. Note to review @ 2025-10-15 14:05:44Z.
- 2025-10-15 ‚Äî Cover preview crash fix when loading Admin. Commit: 08fe39b45b449043b28c3e12552635de2c70edb9
  - Direct links: `pages/index.jsx`
  - Notes: Moves the cover upload preview and target state declarations ahead of their cleanup effects so the Admin dashboard no longer throws a client-side exception on load. Note to review @ 2025-10-15 13:54:21Z.
- 2025-10-15 ‚Äî Admin landing crash fix and Assigned Media recovery. Commit: 65c62abe2882c3fd4360dc1236288862ab78b9a1
  - Direct links: `pages/index.jsx`
  - Notes: Restores the admin dashboard, mission modal, and Assigned Media tab by fixing the deployment banner reference order so the page no longer throws an application error. Note to review @ 2025-10-15 13:24:05Z.
- 2025-10-15 ‚Äî Admin meta banner state guards. Commit: 2952ad333ce6beb0d9d2a29e8ac8f83487292040
  - Direct links: `pages/index.jsx`
  - Notes: Normalizes the branch/deployment banner defaults before applying API responses so undefined state can never break the dashboard render loop. Note to review @ 2025-10-15 13:41:37Z.
- 2025-10-15 ‚Äî Admin meta banner, cover upload repair, and Assigned Media fixes. Commit: ddfa091ed00500a9556641f4e747281d2b514570.
  - Direct links: `pages/api/admin-meta.js`, `pages/index.jsx`, `components/AssignedMediaTab.jsx`
  - Notes: Adds a top-of-page branch/deployment banner with timestamps, stabilizes cover drag & drop previews so PNG/JPG art immediately appears in Settings and the Media Pool, resizes the cover workspace, relocates device Save/Close actions beneath the map, and updates Assigned Media to show tag labels with usage counts while restoring the tab from its crash.
- 2025-10-15 ‚Äî Cover upload preview and media tab refresh. Commit: 62919ea47e2d9bf30fdefea10945f61e1286f698.
  - Direct links: `pages/index.jsx`, `components/AssignedMediaTab.jsx`, `components/MediaPool.jsx`
  - Notes: Adds a live blob preview for cover uploads with a 1 MB guardrail, keeps the banner free of cover art, and moves media usage summaries into Assigned Media while the Media Pool now focuses on thumbnails.
- 2025-10-15 ‚Äî Disable game deploys and repair image uploads. Commit: e5c57eed043e6dbd4191e93ab4db801b7871ae36.
  - Direct link: `pages/index.jsx`
  - Notes: Added a Save & Publish deploy toggle that defaults off to block unintended game pushes, hardened drag & drop cover uploads so PNG/JPG art under 1 MB lands in `/media/covers` and syncs into the Media Pool, and refreshed upload handling to accept more image types without corruption.
- 2025-10-15 ‚Äî Removed the config.json quick link from the Admin Control Deck header per QA feedback. Commit: f89ac490b7ce147abe929c38e53b8c1fb470db05.
  - Direct link: `pages/index.jsx`
  - Notes: Keeps the header focused on tab navigation and Save & Publish while leaving the game folder selector and password protection toggle off by default.
- 2025-10-15 ‚Äî Cover workflow alignment & header preview cleanup. Commit: d173490c16c7aad4de654476372e23ccfd78adc1.
  - Direct link: `pages/index.jsx`

- 2025-10-15 ‚Äî Banner terminology refresh & assigned media usage counters. Commit: 0ee8fe81a2c7c96dee0eec8be60999cafbe94774.
  - Direct links: `pages/index.jsx`, `components/AssignedMediaTab.jsx`, `components/MediaPool.jsx`
  - Notes: Renamed the game settings cover UX to a banner workflow with centered title + dual previews in the admin header, duplicated the banner preview as a Cover thumbnail beside the read-only heading, shifted media counts into Assigned Media with tag-aligned listings, and preserved the Game folder and password protection toggles in their off states.
- 2025-10-14 ‚Äî Save & Publish polish + mission/media crash fix. Commit: 9070d1e1f29cd810a96624809cc1d449a2f352bf.
  - Direct link: `pages/index.jsx`
  - Notes: Locks the main header action to ‚ÄúSave & Publish‚Äù with a live cover thumbnail, rebuilds the Game Settings cover picker with drag & drop/upload/media pool options alongside the title, and adds defensive mission plus assigned-media logic to eliminate the client-side exception while data is loading.
- 2025-10-14 ‚Äî Admin deck header realignment & crash guards. Commit: f2d360052ce8e62c7d763e0d5cee3f734a5765d8.

  - Notes: Moves SETTINGS/MISSIONS/DEVICES/TEXT/ASSIGNED MEDIA/MEDIA POOL and the üíæ Save control beside the Admin Control Deck

  - Direct links: `components/AssignedMediaTab.jsx`, `components/MediaPool.jsx`, `pages/index.jsx`
  - Notes: Surfaced media tags within the Assigned Media tab (for icons, devices, rewards, and penalties), hardened tag lookups to eliminate the browser error in the assigned media view, and moved the mission title input into the overlay header while keeping the mission ID read-only next to Save & Close.
- 2025-10-14 ‚Äî Assigned media theming + usage counters polish. Commit: 106ba00d859442d0b4e9add2dd76b53ef16121ab.
  - Direct links: `components/AssignedMediaTab.jsx`, `components/MediaPool.jsx`
  - Notes: Swapped the assigned-media overview and media pool cards to rely on global appearance variables, added per-section item/use totals, and ensured media previews only render when a file is actually in use (with safety guards on the Open action).
- 2025-10-14 ‚Äî Mission/device editors and assigned media summary refresh. Commit: 1ef03a49facc444ce13b37412e076e9dd2e585d9.

  - Direct links: `pages/index.jsx`, `lib/admin-shared.js`, `package.json`
  - Notes: Aligns default UI loadout with the Starfield Dawn preset from branch codex/update-admin-ui-skins-with-textures-huhqvs and increments the package version to 1.2.1 so downstream bundles catch the theme refresh.
- 2025-10-16 ‚Äî Device editor map controls realignment. Commit: 974ddf67a4a52d773578de28d015c9ff6f455f64.

  - Direct link: `lib/admin-shared.js`
  - Direct link: `public/media/skins/`
  - Notes: Re-exports tone helpers so the admin password switch loads without build errors and ships the 12 themed skin backgrounds so the default skin stays legible while the game-side password remains disabled.

Files included (drop into your Next.js project or use as reference):

/components
  - DevicesList.jsx            // Updated device list with up/down, full-row select, thumbnail, inline editor with Trigger ticker & target dropdown
  - InlineMissionResponses.jsx // Updated mission response editor with "Mark as Trigger" switch and preview badge
  - MissionListItem.jsx        // Small mission list item that displays response marker and thumbnail

AppDemo.jsx                   // Simple demo usage of components (not part of your app; for reference)

How to use:
- Copy files into your project's components/ folder.
- Import DevicesList where you render the Device sidebar.
  Example: import DevicesList from '../components/DevicesList'
- Import InlineMissionResponses where you manage mission editor responses.
  Example: import InlineMissionResponses from '../components/InlineMissionResponses'

Notes:
- The components are intentionally self-contained and use inline styles for easy drop-in.
- They expect the parent to handle persistence (saving to missions.json/config).
- The 'Trigger Target' dropdown uses a `triggerDevices` prop; if empty it shows 'None available'.
- The DevicesList inline editor provides a 'Triggered Device (ticker)' input per your request.

If you want, I can:
- Integrate these components into your actual pages/index.jsx and wire up your existing state/handlers.
- Convert styles to your project's theme or CSS modules.
- Add accessible keyboard support for reordering and selection.
