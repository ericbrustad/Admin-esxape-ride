Device & Response UI Package
----------------------------
## Update Log
- 2025-10-14 — Media pool assignment usage detail overhaul. Commit: 4792784ae0b926d3bcf0ff200f6f1109879c11ed.
  - Direct link: `pages/index.jsx`
  - Notes: Replaces the media pool assignment chips with a readable list under each preview and counts Action Media assignments so the summary matches the Assigned Media tab.
- 2025-10-17 — Set Starfield Dawn as default admin skin and bump package version. Commit: 4fb54669263a320fa227306c4bf9b25e35f910dc.
  - Direct links: `pages/index.jsx`, `lib/admin-shared.js`, `package.json`
  - Notes: Aligns default UI loadout with the Starfield Dawn preset from branch codex/update-admin-ui-skins-with-textures-huhqvs and increments the package version to 1.2.1 so downstream bundles catch the theme refresh.
- 2025-10-16 — Device editor map controls realignment. Commit: 974ddf67a4a52d773578de28d015c9ff6f455f64.
  - Direct link: `pages/index.jsx`
  - Notes: Keeps the device radius slider and ring selector anchored above the map while grouping Save, Cancel, and Close in the editor header.
- 2025-10-13 — Admin password protection API fix. Commit: 6ff58c6ee5795a7ee78809f83e5d6b0ffa597ead.
  - Direct link: `pages/api/admin-protection.js`
  - Notes: Restores the admin password toggle endpoint and always keeps the game password state off.
- 2025-10-14 — Admin UI theme helpers + assets. Commit: 860691231af6542e34489ab4cd7ef64fcae63634.
  - Direct link: `lib/admin-shared.js`
  - Direct link: `public/media/skins/`
  - Notes: Re-exports tone helpers so the admin password switch loads without build errors and ships the 12 themed skin backgrounds so the default skin stays legible while the game-side password remains disabled.
- 2025-10-15 — Admin basic auth obeys toggle. Commit: b9d9bbffb5254cbd710aa5545454370d4ec1cb48.
  - Direct link: `middleware.js`
  - Notes: Middleware now checks `/admin-protection.json` before challenging, allowing the password switch to disable prompts while keeping caching for quick reads.

Files included (drop into your Next.js project or use as reference):

/components
  - DevicesList.jsx            // Updated device list with up/down, full-row select, thumbnail, inline editor with Trigger ticker & target dropdown
  - InlineMissionResponses.jsx // Updated mission response editor with "Mark as Trigger" switch and preview badge
  - MissionListItem.jsx        // Small mission list item that displays response marker and thumbnail

AppDemo.jsx                   // Simple demo usage of components (not part of your app; for reference)

How to use:
- Copy files into your project's components/ folder.
- Import DevicesList where you render the Device sidebar.
  Example: import DevicesList from '../components/DevicesList'
- Import InlineMissionResponses where you manage mission editor responses.
  Example: import InlineMissionResponses from '../components/InlineMissionResponses'

Notes:
- The components are intentionally self-contained and use inline styles for easy drop-in.
- They expect the parent to handle persistence (saving to missions.json/config).
- The 'Trigger Target' dropdown uses a `triggerDevices` prop; if empty it shows 'None available'.
- The DevicesList inline editor provides a 'Triggered Device (ticker)' input per your request.

If you want, I can:
- Integrate these components into your actual pages/index.jsx and wire up your existing state/handlers.
- Convert styles to your project's theme or CSS modules.
- Add accessible keyboard support for reordering and selection.
