## Direct Link
- Settings interface: `settings/index.html`

## Summary
- Added a dedicated settings interface that centralizes protection and notification visibility controls so that enable/disable toggles are only available from the settings page.
- Ensured Game Folder access and password requirement toggles both default to the off state, matching audit requirements.
- Persisted toggle selections locally to simplify debugging and verification without external services.

## Notes
- Please review this README for orientation before working on the project.
- Update reference: `a26ae230cdb24d869e6298d85f76596ac6114553` (commit containing the settings interface changes).
- For future updates, replicate the structure in `settings/` to expand or adjust settings behavior.

## Testing Guidance
- Open `settings/index.html` in a browser and validate that all toggles default to the off state.
- Switch each control and refresh the page to confirm persistence behaves as expected.
