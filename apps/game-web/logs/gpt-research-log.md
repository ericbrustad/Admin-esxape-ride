**Developer ↔ GPT Diagnostic Thread**

**Developer:** I'm seeing the Vercel CLI 48.2.9 install fail with `Value of "this" must be of type URLSearchParams`. Could this be coming from our code?

**GPT Advisor:** That error typically fires when something calls a `URLSearchParams` prototype method without the right instance. Check any polyfills or helpers that might mutate the prototype. If we don't patch prototypes, the CLI should behave.

**Developer:** We don't patch URLSearchParams today. Maybe we can neutralize the CLI quirk by binding the methods ourselves while keeping behaviour intact.

**GPT Advisor:** Right—patching the environment before the CLI runs is a safe guardrail. A tiny shim that enforces proper binding would keep third-party code from tripping over the prototype edge cases.

**Developer:** Got it. I'll ship the shim and surface the repo snapshot in the in-game settings so QA can confirm the environment details from the client side, too.
