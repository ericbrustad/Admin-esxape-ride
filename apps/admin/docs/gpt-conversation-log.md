# Operator ↔ GPT Debug Log

---

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-25T15:07:42Z

**You:** The Supabase signing route is double-encoding folder paths and the gallery page hides failures. Turn off any proxy overrides and get the admin build to pass once the fixes land.

**GPT:** Normalized each object path segment before signing, enriched the Supabase gallery with parallel signing plus inline expiry/error details, and reran the admin workspace build without proxy helpers to verify the bundle succeeds.

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-21T02:57:59Z

**You:** I'm seeing an "React has detected a change in the order of Hooks" warning when the admin dashboard loads. What steps should I take to fix this safely?

**GPT:** Ensure that hooks are called in the same order on every render. Avoid returning early before later hooks run or placing hooks inside conditional branches. Refactor any new logic (for example, replacing a `useMemo` added inside a conditional render with a derived value or moving it above the guard) so that the hook call sequence stays stable across renders.

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-22T11:00:00Z

**You:** Can you restructure the repo into a pnpm/turbo monorepo so Vercel can deploy `apps/admin` and `apps/game-web` separately, keep shared helpers in a workspace package, and make sure the settings footer still shows the repo snapshot once everything builds cleanly?

**GPT:** Moved the existing Next.js admin into `apps/admin`, elevated the game bundle to `apps/game-web`, introduced root pnpm/turbo config plus a `packages/shared` stub, updated GitHub/media paths to the new locations, and reran `npm run build` for both apps to confirm everything compiles after the layout shift.

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-21T09:52:41Z

**You:** Can you locate every binary file in the project and give me a GitHub-friendly workaround for managing them?

**GPT:** Inventoried all tracked binaries with a new `npm run list:binaries` helper, published the file list in `docs/binary-asset-guide.md`, and documented a Git LFS-based workflow plus `.gitattributes` guards to keep media assets manageable on GitHub.

---

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-21T12:08:00Z

**You:** The binary audit isn't enough—ensure no new binaries are committed and explain how to keep any required media hidden from GitHub.

**GPT:** Added an allowlisted inventory with failing verification scripts, expanded the binary guide with external-storage workflows, and deduplicated the settings snapshot so repo metadata stays at the bottom of the page.
---

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-21T15:30:00Z

**You:** Remove every tracked binary asset, restructure the media pool so uploads route into the right type (with an "Other" tab), and log repository metadata at the bottom of Settings after verifying the app.

**GPT:** Purged PNG/SVG/MP3 assets from git, replaced them with a manifest-driven media catalog that highlights external or missing files, rewired `/api/list-media` and the upload API to rely on text metadata, and ensured the Settings snapshot keeps repo, branch, commit, deployment, and timestamps anchored at the footer.

---

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-21T18:05:00Z

**You:** Uploads say “0 of 1 uploaded” and the API throws `EROFS` when it tries to write `public/media/manifest.json`. Please make sure the media types still auto-sort, show an “Other” folder, pick up existing entries, and get ready to move everything over to Supabase. Let me know what you still need from me.

**GPT:** Added a writable manifest adapter that falls back to `.next/cache/admin-media/manifest.json` (or custom env paths) whenever the repo directory is read-only, exposed the active storage path in the API responses for debugging, refreshed the Media Pool inventory logic, and documented the Supabase bucket requirements so we can finish the migration once credentials arrive.

---

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-21T15:30:00Z

**You:** Restore every deleted media asset, wire the Admin APIs to Supabase so uploads, settings, missions, and devices save into bucket directories, and make sure the Settings footer still shows the repository metadata.

**GPT:** Recovered the full media pack in `public/media/**`, refreshed the manifest so each item points at the restored files, added a Supabase storage adapter that uploads binaries and mirrors JSON (missions/settings/devices) into dedicated prefixes, updated the media listing to surface Supabase objects, and kept the Settings footer metadata intact after verifying the build.

---

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-21T16:45:00Z

**You:** GitHub flagged the previous fix because it reintroduced binaries. Please reapply the zero-binary rule, keep the manifest useful for Supabase, and document how the dashboard still finds settings, missions, and device JSON in storage.

**GPT:** Deleted every tracked media binary, restored `.gitkeep` placeholders for the expected directory structure, rewrote the manifest to reference Supabase bucket paths, refreshed the binary asset guide with the zero-binary workflow, and confirmed the Supabase sync helpers still mirror settings, missions, and devices.

---

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-21T17:05:00Z

**You:** All image previews disappeared after the zero-binary update. Bring back the new placeholders alongside the legacy images, keep using the latest Supabase configuration, and make sure settings, missions, and devices still sync into their directories.

**GPT:** Added a reusable SVG placeholder library, updated the media manifest to pair each Supabase object with a local thumbnail plus metadata, taught `/api/list-media` to emit placeholder-aware previews, refreshed the storage guide, and revalidated the Supabase sync directories for settings, missions, and devices.

---

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-21T19:20:00Z

**You:** Uploading new media still fails with `ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir '/var/task/next/cache/admin-media'`. Keep the Supabase workflow, but make sure manifest updates land somewhere writable so cards appear again.

**GPT:** Pointed the manifest fallback to the runtime temp directory (`/tmp/admin-media/manifest.json`) so serverless environments can persist updates, and extended the binary asset guide with the new troubleshooting step while re-running the build.

---

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-23T18:20:00Z

**You:** Reapply the Node.js 20 requirement everywhere so our toolchain stays on the supported LTS version.

**GPT:** Updated the workspace, admin app, and game web app `engines.node` fields to `20.x` so installs and CI runs all target Node.js 20, matching the existing Volta pin.

---

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-23T19:45:00Z

**You:** Lock every engine entry to Node 20.18.1 exactly—no wildcard ranges allowed.

**GPT:** Replaced each `20.x` engine range with `20.18.1`, refreshed the drop-in docs, and synced the Settings UI badges so QA sees the precise LTS build we require.
---

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-25T15:13:29Z

**You:** Turn off all proxies and try again so the Supabase signing endpoint works with the Admin viewer. Reapply the original signing route and simple gallery.

**GPT:** Reset the repo to commit 8de3300, restored the Supabase signing API and gallery test page, and prepared to verify settings metadata after testing.

---

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-25T20:30:00Z

**You:** Override any yarn build references in development so the admin workspace only relies on npm.

**GPT:** Updated the admin metadata API and settings footer to surface npm runtime details instead of yarn, preserved pinned package manager info, and reran the admin build to confirm the npm-first workflow passes.
