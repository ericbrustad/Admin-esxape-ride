## Conversation Snapshot
- **User**: “I want to begin the directory process. lets connect supabase.”
- **GPT (gpt-5-codex)**: Planned the Supabase connection groundwork, implemented a REST helper plus health endpoint, and surfaced status indicators inside the admin banner while noting all updates in the README and logs.

## Actions Recorded

2. Added `/api/directories` to report health or list directory records without exposing secrets.
3. Surfaced Supabase status pills, notes, and timestamps at the top of `pages/index.jsx` alongside repo/deployment metadata.
4. Logged this collaboration per instructions for future traceability.
